# git-config commands like add/remove are not smart enough to add/remove settings
# from the proper place in your ~/gitconfig file when using shared configs. You may 
# need to add/remove them manually. If you store your ~/.gitconfig file in a git repository
# itself then it will be extremely easy to see if unexpected changes occurred. For more
# information on how-to do that contact your local git ninja.
